# Blender-Work
 A collection of my blender work. Past and on going

Mainly consists of hard surface modeling. These are exercises to learn more about the 3d content creation pipeline. 
  
Here are some examples:  

## Yggdrasil:

<img src="yggdrasil.png" width = "1000"> 
For this piece, I tried to become more comfortable with transparent materials. I used volumetrics for the background and tree leaves. Additionally, I used a refractive glass shader for the trunk and branches. Inside each branch, I added an emissive vein that represents the energy coursing through the tree. A particle system was used to create the stars.

## Hyper Light Difter:

This was my submision to pwnisher's boss fight 3d render challenge. I modelled, rigged, textured, and animated everything myself. I learned a lot along the way and I am proud of the progress I made as an artist.

## Flower:

For this render I learned how use Blender's hair particle system. Additionally, I refined my ability to light the subject in an interestingw way for a satifying render.

## Wizard Boy:

I tried scultping a stylized character but still using realistic materials. I got more comfortable scultping clothes. I'll hopefully rig him soon :)

## Mountain Keep:

This taught me a lot about composition and materials. 

## Texture Painting:

This was an introduction to texture painting and my first time using a drawing tablet. I was influenced by Arcane's artstyle and watching Spiderverse.

I did some further work with a study on water melon and a full scene with an x-wing. I find it useful to use the render preview in order to gauge how the light and shadow should be painted.

## Cubes:
<img src="glass cubes.png" width = "500">  
For this image, I wanted to try using a wide variety of materials including glass while improving my composition and lighting.   

 ## Venom in a bottle:  
<img src="Venom.png" width = "500">  
 With this scene, I learned the basics of sculpting. I mainly used the snake hook and smoothing brushes. Additionally, it was an opportunity to refine my hard-surface modeling skills while creating the blockout and the bottle.
 
 ## Desert Planet:  
<img src="Desert.png" width = "500">  
 This render taught me the basics of navigating within blender as well as using simple shapes to make interesting visual.   
 
 ## Robot buddy:  
<img src="Robot.png" width = "500">  
 This render taught me the basics for character design in addition to material workflows. 

 ## Room
 <img src="RoomRender1.png" width = "500">  
 Although I am still working on it, this scene taught me the versatility of modifiers and working with the camera
 
 ## Pistol
 <img src="pistolAnim.gif" width = "500">  
 This application was for a game that I'm making within unity. It introduced me to keyframe animation within blender through using a timeline sequencer and the action editor. (Check out the video for a better fps/resolution)
