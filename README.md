# Blender-Work
 A collection of my blender work. Past and on going

Mainly consists of hard surface modeling. These are exercises to learn more about the 3d content creation pipeline. 
  
Here are some examples:  
 ## Desert Planet:  
<img src="Desert.png" width = "500">  
 This render taught me the basics of navigating within blender as well as using simple shapes to make interesting visual.   
 
 ## Robot buddy:  
<img src="Robot.png" width = "500">  
 This render taught me the basics for character design in addition to material workflows. 

 ## Room
 <img src="RoomRender1.png" width = "500">  
 Although I am still working on it, this scene taught me the versatility of modifiers and working with the camera
 
 ## Pistol
 <img src="pistolAnim.gif" width = "500">  
 This application was for a game that I'm making within unity. It introduced me to keyframe animation within blender through using a timeline sequencer and the action editor. (Check out the video for a better fps/resolution)
